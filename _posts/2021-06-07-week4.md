title: Week 4
---

This week I needed to finish the online grocer survey; however, I needed to update the attribute list since 30 is way too many. So I made 4 categories to narrow down the attributes. The categories were Nutrient Information, Quantifiable Information, Other Products, and Extra where extra included attributes I thought were noticeable enough to mention such as when pages had directions, recipes, and alternate payment options. I also started to come up with some ideas to move onto the design space characterization that is scheduled to start next week.
