In the third week of the Fins project, I started a survey of what information online grocers give consumers about products. I decided to show this survey through Google Sheets. I looked up all major online grocers that span across the United States, so we had a diverse selection since every region has different stores. We decided on 14 different stores, then we had about 30 different attributes to represent what each page provided the consumer. In order to get a full understanding of what each store provided, I checked 8 items that represent 8 major food groups upon each store. These 8 groups included produce, meat, canned goods, sweets, beverages, dairy, grains, and snacked foods.
