This week out our meeting, we discussed many ways to create a design guideline of how we should represent food data to consumers. We discussed interactive measures we could take and visualization genres we could follow. In the end, we decided I would create 4 drawings this week, two witin the genre of a slideshow, one interactive and one static. The other two would be seen as a partition poster, one interactive and one static. Then, next week we will decide which is the best option to use for our human study. Also, we have to discuss how we want to do the study whether that be through an eye tracker or think aloud interviews.
