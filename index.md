## About My Project

The HCI Lab has recently begun a project called Food Information Networks(FINs) to use technological innovation for food dessert access issues. For this summer, I will be assessing literature and survey how food information is currently communicated through online grocery stores. Then, we will be developing a visual narrative of a 'food story' to communicate the important facts to a consumer such as ingredients, nutrition, branding, prices, portion sizes, etc.
